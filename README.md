# FLIGHT-BOOKING-PRICE-PREDICTION


This project analyzes flight booking data and builds machine learning models to predict ticket prices. Using Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn, the dataset is loaded and explored to understand its characteristics. Visualization techniques illustrate relationships between variables and price trends. Categorical variables are encoded, and numerical features are standardized for model training. Three regression models—Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor—are trained and evaluated based on metrics like R-squared score and mean absolute error. The Random Forest Regressor emerges as the most accurate model, offering insights for optimizing pricing strategies in the aviation industry.
